REDUX
a standalone third party library
make state management, the management of application state easier (HOW?)
when we have to pass data around through query props, state management became unnecessarily difficult.

STATE
determines what needs to be rendered
submit data
authentication
UI state (local)

need state information in a totally different area 
-> need to create a connection
-> react doesnt react to global state management (efficiency)

redux gives us a certain flow of data
Central store -> entire app state (giant JS obj)
component needs to have a clear and predictable process of updating state
ACTION (dipatches from comp) -> info package + payload, messenger, doesn't hold logic
REDUCER -> define code for actions, function recieves old state and action returns updated state(new js obj), no async, no sideeffects
store triggers all subscriptions
comp can subscribe to store updates
